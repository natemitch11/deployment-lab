            Lenora Shane is a noble who is originally from the 10 towns area.
            Her mother, Duvessa Shane, is the speaker of Brynshandr. Lenora
            Shane is the epitome of chivalry and morality. She will always stop
            to help those in need. A copy of her Paladin's oath can be found
            pounded in by her armored fist on the message board of most towns in
            the Region. You can see her gleaming armor leading the way into
            battle and water boils under her divine smite's. This is a warning
            to all ne'er-do-wells... if you see Miss Shane...<br /><br />
            Run.

            Talâ€™athor is a 188-year-old High Elf, who was a savant wizard who is set to gain revenge and unlock the secrets of undeath. Talathor set out to the distant cold north of Icewind Dale. Having been exploring the local ruins around the ten towns, and the country side for some time now, his efforts to find the Crystal shards remain elusive, some of the ancient text has referenced Empire of Netheril having relics located in Icewind Dale,  his best efforts to continue his studies have been suppressed by the presence of the Arcane Brotherhood, who have been active in the Reigon. Many of the ruins Talathor would like to investigate are simply too dangerous to enter alone, and he now seeks assistance to gain access to some of the more remote areas of icewind dale.
