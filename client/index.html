Lenora Shane is the epitome of chivalry and morality. She will always stop to help those in need. A copy of her Paladin's oath can be found pounded in by her armored fist on the message board of most towns in the Region. You can see her gleaming armor leading the way into battle and water boils under her divine smite's. This is a warning to all ne'er-do-wells... if you see Miss Shane...<br><br> Run.</p>
