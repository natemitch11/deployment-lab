            Lenora Shane is a noble who is originally from the 10 towns area.
            Her mother, Duvessa Shane, is the speaker of Brynshandr. Lenora
            Shane is the epitome of chivalry and morality. She will always stop
            to help those in need. A copy of her Paladin's oath can be found
            pounded in by her armored fist on the message board of most towns in
            the Region. You can see her gleaming armor leading the way into
            battle and water boils under her divine smite's. This is a warning
            to all ne'er-do-wells... if you see Miss Shane...<br /><br />
            Run.

            Talâ€™athor is a 188-year-old High Elf, who was a savant wizard who is
            set to gain revenge and unlock the secrets of undeath. Talathor set
            out to the distant cold north of Icewind Dale. Having been exploring
            the local ruins around the ten towns, and the country side for some
            time now, his efforts to find the Crystal shards remain elusive,
            some of the ancient text has referenced Empire of Netheril having
            relics located in Icewind Dale, his best efforts to continue his
            studies have been suppressed by the presence of the Arcane
            Brotherhood, who have been active in the Reigon. Many of the ruins
            Talathor would like to investigate are simply too dangerous to enter
            alone, and he now seeks assistance to gain access to some of the
            more remote areas of icewind dale. <br /><br />The quiet wrath of
            Tal'athor leaves destruction and ruin in his wake, if you find
            yourself on the wrong side of fate, just hope he doesn't head off
            your exit with a demon. And if he does... enjoy being his latest
            necromantic experiment.

            Sirmos is a Tiefling businessman hailing from the great Baldur's
            Gate. He ran a reputable establishment there and had a lovely
            family. A family he tragically lost. Lost and alone Sirmos wandered
            the lands trying to fill the gaping void left by the death of his
            family. He put his masterful brewing skills to good use and
            eventually found himself in the frozen plains of Icewind Dale. There
            he found himself drifting aimlessly as a member of the secretive
            organization, The Black Sword. He felt he needed more fulfillment in
            his journey, so he left on... rocky terms. The thing you need to be
            aware of with Sirmos is that he is always down for a fight and a
            drink... not necessarily in that order. <br /><br />
            If hes angry though... It was nice knowing you
